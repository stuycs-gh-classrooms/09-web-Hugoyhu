<h2>What is KiCAD?</h2>
<p><a href="kicad.org">KiCAD</a> is a free and open-source (FOSS) schematic capture / PCB layout software with features comparable to proprietary and paid alternatives like EAGLE CAD or Altium. Instead of paying hundreds or thousands a year on expensive licenses, you can focus on designing a PCB.</p>

<h2>Advantages of KiCAD</h2>
<p>KiCAD has many features on-par with modern CADs, such as an Interactive Router, Electrical Rules Checking, Design Rules Checking, and direct integration between the schematic and PCB.
<h2>Advantages over EasyEDA</h2>
<p><a href="https://easyeda.com/">EasyEDA</a> is a web-based schematic capture / PCB layout CAD software, and is used by many beginners. Despite having a lower initial setup compared to KiCAD, KiCAD is a significantly more powerful software that remains beginner friendly. EasyEDA lacks key features like interactive router and ERC, which makes it easy to make hazardous mistakes with your PCB.</p>

<h2>Potential Advantages over EAGLE / Altium</h2>
<p> KiCAD is a free software while EAGLE and Altium are not, though they may offer certain student discounts or sponsorships. Both software do have much steeper learning curves compared to KiCAD and you will need to pay for the software when you graduate. Even for large, production designs, companies like <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/">Adafruit</a> are beginning to evaluate using KiCAD over EAGLE, and even the Raspberry Pi Foundation has begun to use KiCAD for OSH designs with the RP2040.<p>
