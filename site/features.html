<p>KiCAD is a powerful and FOSS PCB Design CAD software. There are a few main apps that come installed with KiCAD.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Schematic Capture</h3>
    <p>KiCAD uses a hierarchical sheet scheme. Each project can have multiple sheets and you can connect parts of one sheet to another. KiCAD offers an impressive symbol library with thousands of common parts, and additional ones can be imported from Ultra Librarian / SnapEDA. An easy-to-use symbol designer is available as well.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>PCB Layout</h3>
    <p>KiCAD is a one project, one-PCB model. You can quickly update PCBs from schematic with one button. By default, powerful tools like Interactive Router prevent unintentional shorts. Unlike free versions of proprietary software, there are no limits to PCB board size, and supports up to 16 copper layers. KiCAD is highly customizable!</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>3D Viewer</h3>
    <p>Without opening any additional apps, a built-in PCB viewer allows you to generate 2D and 3D models of your PCB. You can import custom models or use pre-installed bundled models. KiCAD also gives you raytracing support for better boards, and the ability to customize colors and orientation to your heart's content.</p>
  </li>

</ul>

<li>
<h3>Open Source Hardware</h3>
<p>KiCAD is the preferred CAD software for open source hardware designs. Engineers across the world use KiCAD for OSHW-certified designs, including even companies like Adafruit and the Raspberry Pi Foundation.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3>Free!</h3>
<p>Altium Designer, a preferred choice among engineers, starts at $4235/year for an subscription license and $11970 for a perpetual license. Allegro costs $1,500 a month. By comparison, KiCAD is completely free with latest release and nightly updates.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3>Customizable, Easy Out-of-Box</h3>
<p>KiCAD offers a powerful parts and symbol library upon installation, providing many common parts you'll need. In the event a part isn't in the default libraries, you can find one at SnapEDA or UL or design your own symbol/footprint.<p>
</li>
